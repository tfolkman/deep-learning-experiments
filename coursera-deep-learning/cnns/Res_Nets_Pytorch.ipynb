    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of this week! You will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.\n",
